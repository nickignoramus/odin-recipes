<h1>Vegan Lasagna 2</h1>
<img src="../images/lasagna.jpg">
<p>Vegan version of an old favorite, easy to modify for manicotti, stuffed shells or with more, less or different veggies. If you'd like some vegan cheese, top the lasagna with soy cheese before baking. Soft tofu yields wetter lasagna; use firm tofu for drier lasagna.</p>
